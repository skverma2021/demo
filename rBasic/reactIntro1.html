                        <ul><strong>Development vs. Production:</strong>
                            <li>During development, the focus is on improving code, debugging, and rapid iteration.</li>
                            <li>In production, the goal is to optimize performance, reduce load times, and ensure stability for end users.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <ul><strong>Development Process:</strong>
                            <li>When you’re developing an application, the traditional approach involves bundling all your code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.) into a single bundle.</li>
                            <li>This bundled file is served to the browser, which then executes it.</li>
                            <li>However, during development, this bundling step can be time-consuming and hinder the development workflow.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <ul><strong>Vite’s Approach:</strong>
                            <li>Vite takes a different approach, especially during development.</li>
                            <li>Instead of creating a monolithic bundle upfront, Vite serves individual modules directly to the browser.</li>
                            <li>When you import a module (e.g., a JavaScript file), Vite fetches it on demand without bundling everything together.</li>
                            <li>This dynamic loading speeds up development because only the necessary modules are fetched.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <ul><strong>Benefits of Dynamic Loading in Development:</strong>
                            <li>Faster Iteration: You see changes almost instantly without waiting for a full bundle rebuild.</li>
                            <li>Efficient Caching: The browser caches individual modules, so subsequent loads are faster.</li>
                            <li>Reduced Overhead: No need to bundle everything upfront during development.</li>
                            <li>Module-Level HMR: Hot Module Replacement (HMR) works at the module level, updating only what’s necessary.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <ul><strong>Production Builds:</strong>
                            <li>For production, Vite still generates optimized bundles (using Rollup or other tools).</li>
                            <li>These bundles are minified, tree-shaken, and optimized for performance.</li>
                            <li>The development experience remains fast, but the final output is production-ready.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <TheSummary theColor='blue'>
                        In summary, Vite’s dynamic loading approach during development allows the browser to share responsibility by fetching individual modules as needed. It’s a refreshing departure from the traditional bundling process and significantly improves the development experience.
